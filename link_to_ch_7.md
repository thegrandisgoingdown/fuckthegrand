"Speaking in general, tenant-landlord attorney Jacob Eppler said tenants aren't necessarily out of luck in this type of situation. 'If I was one of these tenants, I think I would push back on this and say, 'Well, then **I need to get an apartment, and this one was $2,000 a month, and the best one I can find is $2,400. That'll be $400 per month of damages.** It's not my fault that your property fell apart,'' he said."
