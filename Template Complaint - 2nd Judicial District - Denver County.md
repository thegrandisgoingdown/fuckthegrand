[you vs. the grand - distrcit 2 court template.docx](https://github.com/thegrandisgoingdown/fuckthegrand/files/9245199/you.vs.the.grand.-.distrcit.2.court.template.docx)

Welcome to the template for filing a lawsuit for $25,000 or more against The Grand/Greystar in the Second Judicial District Court in Denver! Click the above link to download and get started!

This template sets forth facts for claims of breach of contract, detrimental reliance/promissory estoppel, and intentional infliction of emotional distress. Delete facts that don't apply to you or that you don't want to claim. Add facts as needed. Modify sections with information specific to you. 

There are instructions, comments, and guidance in yellow highlighted brackets throughout. Fill in the brackets that require information specific to your situation. Modify the document as needed. Then delete the yellow brackets, including any notes/instructions. 

Feel free to use this template as a baseline for your attorney to file a lawsuit (a/k/a complaint) against The Grand/Greystar in the 2nd Judicial District/Denver County
Court. Your lawyer is probably going to want to tweak some things as a matter of personal preference (lawyers are notorious pencil fuckers; they can't NOT modify anything), but this should save them time and you money. 

Alternatively, you can sue The Grand/Greystar on your own (called pro se) and represent yourself. This may be a bit more daunting than if you filed in County Court, but County Court only hears claims for under $25,000. If your damages exceed the limits set for County Court, youâ€™ll have to file in District Court. 

To file pro se in District Court, follow the instructions at https://www.courts.state.co.us/Self_Help/morethan25000/ (also available in this repo at https://github.com/thegrandisgoingdown/fuckthegrand/blob/main/district_court_instructions). Make sure you read the instructions carefully and follow all rules and instructions to the letter! Judicial Court is not going to be as lenient with pro se plaintiffs as County Court would be. 

The simplified procedure rules are available at https://casetext.com/rule/colorado-court-rules/colorado-rules-of-civil-procedure/chapter-2-pleadings-and-motions/rule-161-simplified-procedure-for-civil-actions#:~:text=Documents%20and%20other%20evidentiary%20materials,2)%20Disclosure%20of%20Expert%20Witnesses.

Once you file your complaint and Civil Case Cover Sheet with the court clerk and the clerk provides you with a summons (and case number and division and courtroom info for your complaint (this template)), you will need to cause those documents to be served on the defendants you are suing. If you have an attorney, they will take care of this. Note that you cannot serve these documents on The Grand/Greystar (a party to a case may not serve the defendants). Even if you are wanting to do this on the cheap, it's probably worth hiring a process server for this bit. Anyone over the age of 18 can serve The Grand/Greystar, but they will need to understand the rules of service (see https://casetext.com/rule/colorado-court-rules/colorado-rules-of-civil-procedure/chapter-1-scope-of-rules-one-form-of-action-commencement-of-action-service-of-process-pleadings-motions-and-orders/rule-4-process). Whoever you wind up using to serve The Grand/Greystar will need to return a completed Affidavit of Service to you for you to file with the court. 

Note than even if you start off filing pro se, you can hire an attorney at any point to step in and represent you.
