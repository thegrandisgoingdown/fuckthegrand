In contrast, a claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress in Colorado has just three elements:

The defendant engaged in extreme and outrageous conduct;
The defendant did so recklessly or with the intent of causing the plaintiff severe emotional distress; and
The defendantâ€™s conduct caused the plaintiff severe emotional distress.
See Colo. Jury Instr., Civil 23:1 citing Rugg v. McCarty, 476 P.2d 753, 756 (Colo. 1970)
