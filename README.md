If you're here, you've been fucked over by Greystar/The Grand and want to make them pay! Yay! This repo contains templates and resources to help you sue Greystar/The Grand with or without an attorney. 

If you have an attorney, completing a template and providing it to them will likely reduce the amount of time they have to spend drafting an initial complaint, which should translate to you being billed for less time than if they had to start from scratch. If you choose to sue without an attorney, each court provides step-by-step instructions on how to file and then serve your lawsuit, applicable filing fees, etc. Those same instructions have been reproduced in this repo. Continue reading for more!

Nothing herein creates an attorney/client relationship and all that jazz. 

Some things to know: 
The Civil Division of the County Court handles money suits in which the claim is less than $25,000.00. If your claim is $25,000 or more, the 2nd Judicial District/Denver County is probably your best bet if you are wanting to file in Colorado. See https://www.courts.state.co.us/Courts/Index.cfm. 

But not to worry! There are templates for both! 

See fuckthegrand/Template Complaint - Denver County Court.md if you wnat to sue The Grand for less than $25,000. 

See fuckthegrand/Template Complaint - 2nd Judicial District - Denver County.md for template if you want to sue The Grand for $25K+. 

These templates are licensed under the WTFPL! Do whatever you want to with them! You can modify them in order to sue The Grand/Greystar on your own (called pro se). Or you can complete them to the best of your ability and give them to your attorney so that they spend less time drafting the initial complaint (hopefully saving you some $$$). You can link to this repo. You can start your own using the all or some of the same contents. You can give the templates to your friends and family (and strangers). Spread them far and wide! 

NOTE: You don't have to file in Colorado; choice of venue is proper if the court is located in a judicial district where the defendant resides or where the events giving rise to the claim occurred. A lawsuit may, however, be transferred to another US venue if that venue is more convenient or if the plaintiff's chosen venue is improper. Non-lawyer speak, you can sue The Grand in Delaware or SF or some other jurisdiction where their LLCs reside. They'll probably fight you on venue, but that will cost them more in attorneys' fees than you in representing yourself pro se. If there is substantial interest in fighting for venue elsewhere, I'll also consider posting a reply/response to Defendants' Motion to Change Venue. All roads may lead back to Colorado, but the PLAINTIFF gets to decide where to file suit. Note that the templates are specific to Denver. If we wind up filing outside of Denver, I'll update this repo with resources for that court. 

County Court is going to be more pro se friendly, but discovery will be more limited. While Judicial Court is a bit more difficult to navigate because of all the rules pro se plaintiffs aren't typically familiar with, it's those same rules that give you the right to more methods of discovery. However, that discovery will still be limited by the Simplified Procedure unless your damages are over $100,000.
