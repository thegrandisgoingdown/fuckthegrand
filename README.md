If you're here, you've been fucked over by Greystar/The Grand and want to make them pay! Yay! Template complaints and pro se resources coming soon!

Nothing herein creates an attorney/client relationship and all that jazz. 

Some things to know: 
The Civil Division of the County Court handles money suits in which the claim is less than $25,000.00. If your claim is $25,000 or more, the 2nd Judicial District / Denver County is probably your best bet if you are wanting to file in Colorado. See https://www.courts.state.co.us/Courts/Index.cfm. 
You don't have to file in Colorado; choice of venue is  proper if the court is located in a judicial district where the defendant resides or where the events giving rise to the claim occurred. A lawsuit may, however, be transferred to another US venue if that venue is more convenient or if the plaintiff's chosen venue is improper. Non-lawyer speak, you can sue The Grand in Delaware or SF or some other jurisdiction where their LLCs reside. They'll probably fight you on venue, but that will cost them more in attorenys' fees than you in representing yourself pro se. If there is substantial interest in fighting for venue elsewhere, I'll also consider posting a reply/response to Defendats' Motion to Change Venue. All roads may lead back to Colorado, but the PLAINTIFF gets to decide where to file suit. 

County Court is going to be more pro se friendly, but discovery will be more limited. While Judicial Court is a bit more difficult to navigate because of all the rules pro se plaintiffs aren't typically familiar with, it's those same rules that give you the right to more methods of discovery.
